This is a repo for housing tutorials on SciRuby tools under one roof.

It is advised to keep your tutorials in a place where there links do not change, therefore as far as possible keep content in this repo itself. Blogs and videos of course, need not be kept here.

If you have any tutorials to contribute, clone the repo and add your tutorial under the relevant heading. If you need to keep assests in this repo do so such that IT DOES _NOT_ CHANGE the placement of assets kept by others. Same goes to links placed in the README. This is for avoiding broken links.

If you must add a new header, make sure it's in alphabetical order. 'Misc' should be last, though.
